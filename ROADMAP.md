# Roadmap

This is the roadmap for the fork. It is grouped by area, and each row has a horizon: Now, Next, Later or Ideas. How the roadmap works, and how it connects to designs and plans, is in [`planning/README.md`](planning/README.md).

A row records intent. It is not a product decision and it is not a go-ahead to build. A new control, a changed default or a changed shortcut waits for the maintainer's answer, as `CLAUDE.md` says.

Sources: open issues, [`TODO.md`](TODO.md), tracker issue #25 and the merged PRs of 2026-10-18, 2026-10-19, 2026-10-20, 2026-10-21, 2026-10-22 and 2026-10-23.

## Releases and live validation

`main` is more than 320 commits past `v2.2.0`, the only fork release. The agent control actions, worktree-by-default, the new sidebar layout and the worktree start points have never run in a live app. Issue #25 is the tracker. On 2026-10-17 the maintainer decided on an unsigned local build for the Mac, because there is no Apple ID.

| Title                                   | Horizon | Status   | Intent                                                                                                                                                                                          | Links |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Live validation of the merged work      | Now     | planned  | Call every control action with good and bad input, run worktree creation and the Auto-create switch, and use the sidebar with real requests. Do it on an isolated server first.                 | #25   |
| Cut a fork release newer than `v2.2.0`  | Now     | planned  | Dispatch `release.yml` at the validated commit. The version number is an open decision.                                                                                                         | #25   |
| Post-merge review of the sidebar layout | Now     | planned  | PR #20 merged before any review finished. Check the stored-layout upgrade path in particular.                                                                                                   | #25   |
| Install the fork build on the Mac       | Next    | proposed | Replace upstream's signed app with a locally built, unsigned fork build. It loses upstream's auto-update. The maintainer decides.                                                               | #25   |
| Open decisions after live use           | Later   | proposed | Whether new worktrees start from `origin/main`, agents create worktrees by default, the `openchamber/` branch prefix goes, the sidebar layout is the default, and which model names a worktree. | #25   |

## Sessions and sidebar

| Title                                 | Horizon | Status   | Intent                                                  | Links |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Sidebar view mode without headers     | Next    | proposed | Keep the section order and drop the headers.            | #21   |
| Choose session row lines and elements | Next    | proposed | Let the user pick what a session row shows.             | #22   |

## Nested subagents

Subagents can launch subagents. Asks from any depth reach the root session, and Work Status nests running subagents under the one that started them. Ancestor walks count chains at any depth: the old 8-level cap is gone (#123).

## Agent control and worktrees

| Title                             | Horizon | Status   | Intent                                                                                                                                 | Links |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `browser.scroll` stops timing out | Next    | proposed | It reports "in-app browser did not respond within 20s" every time.                                                                     | #31   |
| Name the worktree-naming model    | Later   | proposed | Today the session's model names a worktree and delays the first turn by up to 15 s. Two cheaper options were offered and not answered. | #25   |

## Routing, knowledge and cost

These ask for features that sit on top of the OpenCode fork's routing and plan tracking. See `developing-today/opencode`'s roadmap.

| Title                                              | Horizon | Status   | Intent                                                 | Links |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Model tier chooser and quota fallback card         | Later   | proposed | An interactive card through `render.page awaitAnswer`. | #14   |
| Tier-aware dispatching and cost tracking           | Later   | proposed | For Project Knowledge plans.                           | #16   |

## Sync and transport

## Upgrades without dropped sessions

Both rows are proposals from `TODO.md`. They need the maintainer's approval of a design before any code.

| Title                                                                 | Horizon | Status   | Intent                                                                                                          | Links                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| A supervisor that owns the listener and the managed OpenCode children | Later   | proposed | OpenChamber upgrades or restarts with no dropped sessions and no port change.                                   | #81, [TODO](TODO.md) |
| A versioned state store and handoff record                            | Later   | proposed | One store for each OpenCode generation, with a write-ahead handoff record and a reaper that does not read `ps`. | #82, [TODO](TODO.md) |

## Quality and CI

| Title                        | Horizon | Status      | Intent                                                                                                                                  | Links |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| UI tests pass in one process | Now     | in-progress | A combined `bun test` shows phantom failures from leaked module mocks. Several files are fixed and five failures remain in `src/hooks`. | #46   |
| Anti-slop backlog            | Later   | planned     | 9,498 findings in 1,086 files, worked in three phases from the cheapest.                                                                | #80   |
