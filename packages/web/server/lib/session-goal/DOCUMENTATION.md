# Session Goal

Server-side control loop that keeps a session working toward a user-defined
objective stored under `metadata.openchamber.goal`, with Jev (the
classification model) or the small model as an independent progress check. Built on OpenChamber's backend-driven
architecture (session-assist is the structural template): the loop lives in
the web server and survives UI disconnects.

## Goal payload (`metadata.openchamber.goal`)

```
{
  id,                      // opaque per-logical-goal id; stale-write guard
  objective,               // inline user text (fallback), <= the goal length limit, ignoreObjectiveLimit too (it is broadcast with every update)
  objectiveFile,           // true: objective text lives in a server-side file
  ignoreObjectiveLimit,    // true: the user switched the length limit off for this goal
  status,                  // active | paused | blocked | budgetLimited | complete
  tokenBudget,             // optional positive int
  tokensUsed,              // tokensCommitted + current segment (snapshot - baseline)
  tokensBaseline,          // segment start snapshot (pre-goal turn; 0 after compaction)
  tokensCommitted,         // closed segments' total (one segment per compaction)
  turnsUsed,               // auto-continuations sent (capped at the Settings turn limit)
  auditFailStreak,         // consecutive progress checks that could not run
  statusReason,            // why settled; 'resumed' is a kickoff signal from UI
  evaluationProviderID,    // provider of the latest check; '' when Jev answered
  evaluationModelID,       // model of the latest check (Jev's model id for Jev)
  lastAccountedMessageID,  // incremental accounting cursor
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

The UI writes goals (create/edit/pause/resume/clear) by patching this
metadata; the runtime never creates a goal on its own. Goal creation happens
at send time via the arm store (`useSessionGoalArmStore`): the composer
target button arms "the next prompt is the objective", and the run-as-goal
flows (fork-from-answer dialog, plan implement dialog) arm the same way —
the plan flow additionally supplies an objective OVERRIDE carrying the plan
content, since "Implement this plan: X" alone gives the audit nothing to
judge against. Queueing a message consumes the arm too: the goal travels on
that queued item (`goal` in `../message-queue`) and starts when that item is
delivered, by the server queue or by a send from the queue row, and a queued
item without a goal never consumes the composer's arm. The armed send also attaches a synthetic system-reminder
part telling the agent goal mode is active and that each turn should end
with a factual done/verified/remaining statement for the independent audit.
Freshness/stale-write protection is by `id`: every runtime write re-reads the
session and drops the write when the stored goal id no longer matches.

## File-backed objectives

The objective TEXT lives in `<data-dir>/goals/<sessionId>.md` (data dir =
`OPENCHAMBER_DATA_DIR` or `~/.config/openchamber`), keyed by the SESSION ID:
sessions are globally unique and carry one goal at a time, so the mapping is
deterministic and a new goal simply overwrites the file. Metadata carries
only `objectiveFile: true` — never a path — so user-writable metadata cannot
become a file-read vector (`objectives.js` also validates the id shape
before touching the filesystem). Rationale: metadata rides every
`session.updated`, so multi-KB objectives must not live there.

- `objectives.js` — write/read/delete, and `goalObjectiveLimits(settings)`:
  the goal length limit (`sessionGoalObjectiveCharLimit`, default 5000) and
  how much of a goal the progress check reads
  (`sessionGoalCheckObjectiveCharLimit`, default 20,000), both 1,000 to
  1,000,000. The file itself only clamps at 1,000,000
  (`GOAL_OBJECTIVE_HARD_CAP`): the goal limit is applied before the write, by
  the UI or `create.js`, so a goal whose limit was raised or switched off is
  kept whole. Before 2026-10 the file clamped at 5000.
- `routes.js` — `PUT/GET/DELETE /api/goals/objective/:sessionId`; the PUT
  answers `{ ok, length }`, the length kept, so a client can tell an older
  server cut the text (an older server answers `{ ok }` alone)
  (OpenChamber-owned, registered before the generic proxy; JSON parsing via
  the `/api/goals` family in core-routes). The UI writes the file BEFORE
  patching the goal metadata and falls back to an inline objective when the
  write fails; `clearSessionGoal` deletes the file best-effort.
- The tick resolves the effective objective fresh on every cycle (the file
  is live-editable mid-goal) and falls back to the inline `objective` when
  the file is unreadable — a goal never dies because a file went away.
- UI display fetches content via the GET route
  (`useGoalObjectiveContent`); in VS Code the route is unavailable, so the
  strip shows a generic goal title (display-only fallback by design).
- Server-created goals write the file through `create.js`, which also owns
  objective fitting, inline fallback, metadata creation, and the synthetic
  first-turn reminder shared by scheduled tasks and CLI-created sessions.

- Forks: OpenCode copies the source metadata into a fork, goal included.
  The UI fork paths (`forkAfterMessage`, `forkFromMessage`, `/fork`) then copy
  the objective file to the fork's id, or inline the text when that write
  fails (`packages/ui/src/lib/sessionForkInheritance.ts`). The copy re-reads
  the fork's goal id first and is skipped when the user armed a new goal on
  the fork meanwhile. Forks made through `POST /api/openchamber/sessions/:id/fork`
  (CLI, scheduled tasks) get the same repair server-side before the prompt is
  dispatched (`openchamber-sessions/fork-inheritance.js`); UI forks call
  OpenCode directly, so both implementations exist. `/btw` forks drop the goal
  with the rest of the inherited namespace.

## Goal writer

The goal writer turns a user's message into a goal spec: a clean, detailed
objective within the goal length limit that the agent works from and the
progress check judges against. `spec-writer.js` owns it.

- Route: `POST /api/goals/spec` in `routes.js`, body `{ request,
  conversation?, openItems?, directory?, providerID?, modelID?,
  writerProviderID?, writerModelID?, writerVariant?, ignoreLimit? }`, answer
  `{ spec, providerID, modelID, variant }` naming the model and effort that
  wrote it. A blank
  request is `400` (`goal-spec-request-required`), an empty reply `502`
  (`goal-spec-empty`); other errors keep the generate status. A client that
  disconnects aborts the generation.
- Prompt: `GOAL_SPEC_SYSTEM_PROMPT` asks for Markdown sections Objective,
  Requirements, Constraints, Done when and Out of scope, faithful to the
  request, with paths, commands and names kept verbatim. The user prompt holds
  XML-escaped `<request>`, `<open_items>` and `<conversation>` blocks in that
  order, so a prompt clipped at the tail loses conversation first. The reply
  is cleaned by `normalizeGoalSpec`: think blocks dropped, a fence around the
  whole reply removed, clamped to the goal length limit at a line break when one is
  close.
- Model: a model picked for this spec in a goal window
  (`writerProviderID`/`writerModelID`, with `writerVariant`), else
  `sessionGoalWriterModel` (`provider/model`) with `sessionGoalWriterVariant`,
  else the session's own provider and model at its default effort, else the
  normal small-model chain (`resolveGoalWriterModel`). The effort level goes
  to OpenCode as `model.variant` only with a model named explicitly; a variant
  the model does not have fails the generation. All of them go through
  `generateSmallModelText`, so the writer only reaches models configured in
  OpenCode through `/api/experimental/generate`, the same boundary as the
  small model.
- Length: the system prompt asks for 90% of the goal length limit
  (`buildGoalSpecSystemPrompt`), and the output budget scales with it;
  `ignoreLimit` drops the length line and clamps only at the hard cap.
- Rewrite all: with `sessionGoalRewriteAll` on, `createSessionGoal` runs every
  server-created objective (scheduled tasks, CLI `--goal`, the agent tool's
  `goalAction: set`) through the writer before fitting it. A failed rewrite
  logs a warning and keeps the objective as written. `settled: true` skips
  the rewrite, and `ignoreLimit: true` keeps the objective unfitted, tells the
  writer to drop its length line, and stores `ignoreObjectiveLimit: true`; a
  queued message passes both from the composer. `createSessionGoal`
  returns `{ goal, spec }`; scheduled tasks, queued messages and the sessions route pass the
  spec to `buildGoalIntroText(tokenBudget, spec)`, whose reminder then
  carries it in an escaped `<goal-spec>` block. A slash command normally gets
  no reminder; with a rewritten spec the reminder is admitted with
  `resume: false` before the command, since the spec is not the command's own
  text. The UI builds the same text for goals it arms, so the wording must
  stay identical on both sides.

## Flow

1. `createSessionGoalRuntime` subscribes to the global SSE hub (same pattern
   as session-assist — it needs the envelope's `directory`).
2. `session.status: idle` arms a 15s per-session timer; `busy`/`retry` clears
   it. A `session.updated` carrying a fresh active goal (`turnsUsed === 0` or
   `statusReason === 'resumed'`) arms a kickoff timer — 3s for fresh goals,
   ~250ms for an explicit Resume so the nudge feels immediate — since setting
   a goal on an idle session emits no status transition.
3. On fire (`tick`), gated by the `sessionGoalEnabled` setting:
   - fetch session (skip sub-agent sessions), require an `active` goal;
   - authoritative live-activity check after the quiet window: re-read
     `/api/session/active`, bail if the parent resumed; then list the
      parent's subagent sessions through `GET /api/session?parentID=` (cursor
      paged) and bail while any of them is active. The loop rechecks after
      another quiet window so a missed parent idle event cannot strand the
      goal when the child finishes. A status or children fetch failure is
      unknown, not empty, so it skips the audit and retries after another quiet
      window;
     both reads live in `../opencode/session-activity.js`, shared with the
     notification runtime;
   - messages come from `/api/session/:id/message` as v2's flat records
     (`type`, `content[]`, `model`, `finish`, `tokens`); `toLoopMessage`
     projects them into the `{ info, parts }` view the rest of the tick reads,
     and a completed `compaction` record plays v1's `summary: true` assistant
     turn. v2 gives a compaction only `time.created`, so the projection
     stamps `time.completed` from it: every "finished" check in the tick reads
     `time.completed`, and without it a compaction looks still running. Other
     plumbing roles are dropped from the view;
   - quiescence check via the message tail (trailing user message or
     unfinished assistant reply → bail; the next idle transition re-arms);
   - token accounting as a SNAPSHOT of the latest completed assistant turn:
     `input + cache.read + output`. Earlier turns' inputs and outputs fold
     into the next turn's cache, so the latest snapshot already carries the
     whole run's paid tokens — no summing across messages. Goal-relative via
     `tokensBaseline` (the same snapshot of the newest pre-goal turn,
     captured on the first tick). Compaction (an assistant message with
     `summary: true`) breaks the snapshot chain, so accounting is segmented:
     the summary message closes the segment into `tokensCommitted` (the
     summary turn read the whole context, so its snapshot prices the
     compaction itself) and the next segment starts with a zero baseline.
     `tokensUsed = tokensCommitted + current segment`, kept monotonic so
     unflagged context shrinks never move the budget backwards;
   - a user abort pauses the goal instead of blocking it: the event path in
     `processPayload` pauses immediately on the MessageAbortedError message
     (before any tick could send a continuation over the user's explicit
     stop), with a tick-side safety net. Messages sent while paused leave
     the goal alone; Resume re-arms the loop, and resuming over an aborted
     tail skips the audit and goes straight to a continuation nudge;
    - terminal checks, cheapest first: assistant turn error → `blocked`;
      `tokensUsed >= tokenBudget` → `budgetLimited`;
      `turnsUsed >= ` the turn limit (Settings → Goal, `sessionGoalMaxAutoTurns`, 1–200, default 20; read on every tick) → `blocked`;
    - error classification is independent of `finish`: `MessageAbortedError`
      keeps the pause/resume behavior; only a `finish: "length"` with no
      error, or `MessageOutputLengthError`, is an in-progress truncation that
      skips the audit and continues. Any other non-null error wins over a
      length finish and blocks with its non-empty `error.name`, or
      `assistant turn failed` when unnamed;
    - length recovery is bounded separately from the token budget and
      auto-continuation cap: the first truncation permits one continuation, but
      a second consecutive completed, non-summary assistant turn that is also
      truncated settles the goal as `blocked` (`repeated output truncation`).
      The consecutive state is derived from the loaded message history, not
      persisted, using `info.time.created` chronology rather than message IDs.
      Summary messages are not agent turns; an ordinary completed assistant
      turn naturally breaks the consecutive condition. Explicit Resume grants
      one new recovery attempt over the same transcript; the continuation
      consumes that permission, so another truncation blocks again. Resume
      does not bypass assistant errors or the token budget;
   - otherwise, a progress check of the objective + the last assistant turn
     only — no conversation history and no continuation prompts (`audit.js`).
     Three yes/no questions: does the report say all requested work is done
     (`all_done`), does it name requested work the agent still has to do
     (`remaining`), and is the agent stopped by something only the user can
     provide (`needs_user`). `decideProgress` combines them in code:
     `needs_user >= 0.5` → blocked, `all_done >= 0.5 && remaining < 0.5` →
     complete, anything else → continue. Jev answers with probabilities; the
     small model answers the same questions as JSON booleans read as 1/0, so
     there is one format and one decision. The long turn is cut to its head
     and, mostly, its tail, where the report sits. The objective is cut to
     the check limit (`excerptObjective`, 40% head, 60% tail, where Done when
     sits); a goal within it is passed whole, so the measured wording is
     unchanged. Without that cut, a goal with no length limit would push the
     answer and the closing instruction off the end of a small model's
     prompt, since `generateSmallModelText` truncates from the end. The
     continuation prompt still carries the whole objective.
     Who answers: Jev when `sessionGoalChecker` is `classifier` (an explicit
     pick; the default is `small-model`, since a classification provider set
     up for another feature is not consent to audit goals with Jev) and a
     classification provider can run it (`classifierEndpoint`, owned by
     `../routing`); the small model otherwise, and also when Jev fails this
     time (the session's own provider/model
     preferred). The check is the SOLE termination authority besides the hard
     stops above — the working agent has no channel to settle its own goal.
     `complete` and `blocked` settle on the first such answer: a blocked turn
     waits on the user, and another nudge would only spend a turn repeating the
     question (`statusReason: 'waiting for user input'`). There is no note: the
     strip shows the objective. A check that cannot run tolerates ONE
     consecutive unchecked continuation (`auditFailStreak`); a second
     consecutive failure settles the goal as `blocked` ("progress audit
     unavailable") — resumable, and settling resets the streak so Resume gets
     fresh tolerance. A dead checker can never drive the loop blind to the turn
     cap. Measured on 144 hand-written goal-report turns plus 8 real ones (lab:
     `~/projects/openchamber-extensions/jev-goal-lab`): Jev 142/144 with both
     misses on the safe side, gpt-6-luna 141/144. Change the questions or the
     threshold only with a new run of that lab;
   - continue: persist accounting + `turnsUsed` first (a crash after the
     write just waits for the next idle tick; the reverse could double-send),
     re-check the tail, then `POST /api/session/:id/prompt` with the
     continuation prompt. v2 keeps the model and agent on the session, so the
     prompt runs on what the session already uses; nothing is re-selected —
     the goal spends the session's own subscription.
4. Settling (`complete`/`blocked`/`budgetLimited`) fires the injected
   `emitGoalNotification` so the user hears about it even with the UI closed:
   desktop + UI broadcast + the standard push fanout (web-push with full
   text; APNs with a generic per-type title and the session name as body).
   It obeys the notify-on-completion setting. Conversely, while a goal is
   ACTIVE the notifications runtime suppresses per-turn "ready"
   notifications on every channel — they would only echo the loop's own
   continuations; error/question/permission notifications are untouched.
   Pausing a goal from the UI also aborts the running turn (and vice versa —
   an abort pauses the goal), so "stop" means stop on both axes.

## Continuation prompt

Built inline in `runtime.js`: the objective as untrusted user data in an
XML-escaped `<objective>` block, budget numbers, keep-the-full-objective and
work-from-evidence rules, a completion-audit instruction, and the requirement
to end every turn with a factual done/verified/remaining report — the audit
sees only that final turn, so the report is its evidence.

## UI consumers (packages/ui)

- `lib/sessionGoalMetadata.ts` — payload parsing/types.
- `lib/sessionGoalActions.ts` — create/edit/pause/resume/clear via
  `patchSessionMetadata`; `lib/sessionGoalPresentation.ts` — status
  colors/labels shared across surfaces. `setSessionGoal` takes a cancel
  signal, `ignoreLimit`, and `kickoff` (false writes `statusReason: ''`
  instead of `resumed`, so an edit sent with a message does not ask for an
  immediate check of the last reply against the new objective). An edit
  saves only over the goal it started from (`nextGoalRecord`: same id,
  status and `updatedAt`, checked before the objective file is written and
  again inside the metadata write); otherwise it answers `changed` and
  writes nothing.
- `lib/goalEdit.ts` + `stores/useGoalEditStore.ts` — a save from the goal
  editor runs after the editor closed, one per session (a newer one cancels
  the older). `components/chat/GoalEditStrip.tsx` shows it among the
  composer's top rows under the goal row: the writer at work (Cancel), or
  why it did not land (Reopen brings the edit back into the editor). A
  message written with the change goes out after the goal is saved, with
  `buildGoalUpdateReminder` (the changed goal as a synthetic part): idle
  sessions get a new turn, working ones get it steered into the turn or
  queued after it, as the editor's toggle says (default `followUpBehavior`).
  It goes through `routeMessage` and the message queue directly, not the
  composer, so the composer's armed goal and attachments are untouched; a
  slash command or mention in it is sent as typed text.
- `stores/useSessionGoalArmStore.ts` — the "next prompt starts a goal" flag,
  consumed by `sendMessage` in `sync/session-ui-store.ts` (works for drafts).
  Armed slash commands resolve their authoritative command template and apply
  OpenCode argument expansion (`$ARGUMENTS`, positional placeholders, or the
  implicit argument suffix) for the audit objective before goal metadata is
  written and before `session.command` dispatch. If command details cannot be
  loaded, the raw invocation remains the objective rather than blocking command
  execution.
- `hooks/useSessionGoal.ts` — live goal state.
- `components/chat/SessionGoalButton.tsx` — composer target button
  (arm / status color / cancel confirm); `SessionGoalRow.tsx` — goal row
  among the composer's top rows; `SessionGoalDialog.tsx` — manage dialog
  (edit/pause/resume/complete/clear, an optional message, the writer model
  and effort when the objective will be rewritten, and "No length limit for
  this goal" under its more-options menu). On desktop it resizes from its
  corner; the mobile sheet does not.
- `components/chat/GoalWriterPicker.tsx` — the writer model and effort in a
  goal window. A pick applies to that window; Remember, or
  `sessionGoalWriterRememberChoice`, saves it as the Settings default.
- Sidebar glyph next to the date in `SessionNodeItem`.
- `components/sections/openchamber/SessionGoalCheckerField.tsx` — Settings →
  Chat → Goal: Jev or the small model checks progress
  (`sessionGoalChecker`). Without a classification provider the Jev chip is
  disabled and the small model shows as chosen, matching the server.
  `useGoalCheckAvailable` (`hooks/useSessionGoal.ts`) gates arming a new goal
  on either checker being able to run.

### Goal writer in the UI

- `lib/goalWriter.ts` — `requestGoalSpec` (the route above; a failure comes
  back with its reason, never as an empty spec), `planGoalWriter` (whether a
  send stops for the writer), `buildGoalIntroReminder` (the goal-mode reminder,
  byte-identical to `buildGoalIntroText`), and the context formatting for
  "goal from next message".
- `components/chat/SessionGoalButton.tsx` — `SessionGoalWriterButton`, the
  sparkle switch right of the target (`sessionGoalWriterEnabled`, on by
  default). It shows only while the session has no goal and a progress check
  can run, and reads as on and locked while `sessionGoalRewriteAll` is on.
- `components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` — `handleSubmit` asks `planGoalWriter`
  before anything is taken from the composer. Eligible sends are plain text
  in normal mode: no slash command, shell input, side question, queue flush,
  or a send that auto-review would queue. Two triggers:
  - `armed`: the target is armed and the switch or rewrite-all is on. The
    writer reads the message only.
  - `auto-create`: the session has no goal at all, it is idle, and
    `sessionGoalAutoCreate` is `review` or `auto`. The writer also gets
    `components/chat/goalWriterContext.ts`: the first request and the newest
    turns of the loaded history, open project todos, session-pinned and
    project-pinned plans whose checklist is not done, queued messages and
    running subagent sessions. Every source is best effort; the message alone
    still makes a goal.
- `components/chat/GoalSpecDialog.tsx` — writes the spec (the session's
  composer model is sent as the fallback model), then shows it for approval
  when `sessionGoalWriterReview` is on (armed) or `sessionGoalAutoCreate` is
  `review`. Choices: send the message with the spec as its goal, send the spec
  as the message (`sessionGoalWriterSendMode` picks the primary one and the
  one used without review), write again, or skip: an armed goal keeps the
  message as typed, an automatic one sends without a goal. A failed write
  always waits for the user, review or not. Closing the dialog leaves the
  composer, queue and pending prompts untouched: the choice submits again with
  a `goal` option, and only then is the arm set, right before `sendMessage`.
- `stores/useSessionGoalArmStore.ts` — `settled` marks an objective the writer
  produced or the user kept over it, so rewrite-all leaves it alone;
  `briefAgent` puts the spec into the reminder when the message itself is not
  the spec.
- Rewrite all in the UI: `setSessionGoal` takes `rewrite` with the session's
  model and returns `rewrittenSpec`. `sendMessage` passes it for unsettled
  armed goals (Plan "Run as goal", fork as goal), and `SessionGoalDialog` when
  the typed objective changed. A failed rewrite keeps the user's text and says
  so in a toast. `sendMessage` builds the goal reminder only after the goal is
  saved, so a rewritten spec reaches the agent in the same message.
- A writer request belongs to the composer it came from: switching the
  composer to another session or draft closes the dialog, and a late choice is
  dropped.
- `components/sections/openchamber/SessionGoalWriterFields.tsx` — Settings →
  Chat → Goal: the switch, the writer model (`sessionGoalWriterModel`, read by
  the server only, so it lives in the settings file like the walkthrough
  model), review, send mode, rewrite all, and goal from next message. None of
  it exists in VS Code, which has no goal loop.

## Scheduled goals

Scheduled tasks can run as goals: `execution.goalEnabled` (+ optional
`execution.goalTokenBudget`) on a task makes the scheduled-tasks runtime
write the goal into OpenChamber's session metadata store through the
`persistSessionGoal` seam `server/index.js` hands it (objective = the expanded
task prompt; v2 `CommandInfo` carries no template, so a slash command's
objective is its raw invocation) and attach the goal-mode intro part to normal
prompts. The store write is what arms the loop (`notifyGoalChanged`).

## CLI-created goals

`openchamber session create --prompt <text> --goal` uses the explicit
`POST /api/openchamber/sessions` orchestration route. The server creates the
session, fits and stores the expanded prompt as its objective, patches active
goal metadata, appends the synthetic goal reminder, and only then dispatches
the prompt. `--goal-token-budget` applies the same optional budget contract as
scheduled goals. Slash commands retain command dispatch semantics and cannot
carry the synthetic prompt part. Their command template with OpenCode argument
expansion becomes the audit objective; goal metadata
is still installed before the command runs. A missing command template falls
back to the raw invocation.

`openchamber session send --goal` and `openchamber session fork --goal` use
the same server-owned prompt orchestration. Send installs a fresh goal on the
target session; fork first uses the official OpenCode fork operation (at the
optional message boundary), then installs the goal on the new session. Both
preserve the objective-file-before-metadata and metadata-before-dispatch
ordering used by create and scheduled goals.

## Limitations

- Web-server feature: VS Code (extension-only) renders goal state via
  `session.updated` but does not run the loop.
- A goal on a session with no assistant reply yet starts after the first
  user exchange completes (there is no reply to audit before that).
- `tokensUsed` only counts completed assistant messages seen within the
  40-message fetch window per tick; extremely long busy stretches between
  idles undercount (acceptable: budget is a guardrail, not billing).
