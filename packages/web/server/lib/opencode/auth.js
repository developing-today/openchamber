/**
 * OpenCode's provider credentials as the running OpenCode holds them, shared
 * by the web server and the VS Code extension host. Reads, and one write.
 *
 * OpenCode 2.x owns every credential. Since 2.0.20 it hands them back over
 * `GET /api/credential`, secrets included, so the quota providers, voice keys
 * and routing read what the running OpenCode actually uses. Each call asks
 * OpenCode; concurrent callers share one request. A failed read throws rather
 * than answering `{}`: "OpenCode is unreachable" must not look like "the user
 * has no keys".
 *
 * A key OpenCode picks up from an environment variable (`ZAI_API_KEY`, ...)
 * is never stored, and that route does not list it. `GET /api/integration`
 * names the variable a connection came from, but not its value. When
 * OpenChamber launched OpenCode itself it knows the environment it passed, so
 * the source reads the value from there; an external OpenCode runs with an
 * environment of its own, and its variable keys stay unknown. A stored
 * credential wins over a variable, which is the order OpenCode itself uses.
 *
 * The answer keeps the legacy `auth.json` entry shape the consumers were
 * written against: `{ type: 'api', key }` / `{ type: 'oauth', access, refresh,
 * expires, accountId?, enterpriseUrl? }`, keyed by integration id, which for
 * providers is the provider id. `listStoredCredentials` answers the same
 * values as a row list (id, label, active flag, integration id) for the
 * consumers, quota today, that read every credential of an integration
 * instead of only the selected one.
 *
 * One write exists, `renewStoredLogin`: an isolated space's gatekeeper holds
 * the host's short OpenAI token, and the host keeps it fresh itself, because
 * OpenCode refreshes a login only when the user sends it a prompt. The new
 * login goes in through `POST /api/credential` and the old row is removed
 * after it, which is how OpenCode takes a login from outside.
