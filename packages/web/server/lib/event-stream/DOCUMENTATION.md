# Event Stream Module Documentation

## Purpose
This module contains the OpenChamber message-stream WebSocket protocol and runtime bridge. It keeps the browser-facing WebSocket transport separate from the upstream OpenCode SSE transport.

## Entrypoints and structure
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/index.js`: public entrypoint re-exporting protocol and runtime helpers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/global-hub.js`: shared global upstream SSE hub for server-side subscribers and browser WS fan-out.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/sse-cursor.js`: SSE block parsing and the versioned OpenChamber cursor (`occ1.<stream>.<position>.<upstream>`).
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/replay-store.js`: the bounded, append-only durable store for the global stream's local frames, head and retention watermarks.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/delta-coalescer.js`: merges consecutive `message.part.delta` events before replay and fan-out. Pure, with injectable clock and timers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/global-ws-bridge.js`: browser-facing global WS bridge that subscribes clients to the shared global hub.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/directory-ws-bridge.js`: browser-facing per-directory WS bridge that owns one scoped upstream reader per connection.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/protocol.js`: path constants, SSE envelope parsing, and WebSocket frame serialization helpers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/translate-v2.js`: the single place that maps OpenCode 2.x wire events onto the server's own event vocabulary.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/upstream-reader.js`: reusable upstream SSE reader with event-id tracking, stall recovery, and reconnect handling.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/runtime.js`: thin WebSocket server runtime for upgrade handling and path dispatch to the global/directory bridges.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/protocol.test.js`: unit tests for protocol helpers.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/upstream-reader.test.js`: unit tests for upstream SSE reader behavior.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/runtime.test.js`: unit tests for runtime-side broadcaster behavior.
- `packages/web/server/lib/event-stream/replay-store.test.js`: round-trip, torn-record, reset and compaction tests for the durable store.

## Public exports

### Protocol helpers
- `MESSAGE_STREAM_GLOBAL_WS_PATH`: `/api/global/event/ws`
- `MESSAGE_STREAM_DIRECTORY_WS_PATH`: `/api/event/ws`
- `MESSAGE_STREAM_WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`: heartbeat interval for browser-facing WS connections.
- `parseSseEventEnvelope(block)`: parses an SSE block into `{ eventId, directory, payload }`.
- `sendMessageStreamWsFrame(socket, payload)`: serializes and sends a JSON WS frame.
- `sendMessageStreamWsEvent(socket, payload, options)`: sends an event frame with optional `eventId` and `directory`.
- `serializeMessageStreamWsEvent(payload, options)` and `sendSerializedMessageStreamWsFrame(socket, frame)` separate encoding from per-socket delivery. Delivery retains ready-state and backpressure checks.

### Runtime helpers
- `createGlobalMessageStreamHub(...)`: creates a shared `/global/event` upstream SSE hub with event/status subscribers and bounded event-id replay.
- `createGlobalUiEventBroadcaster({ sseClients, wsClients, writeSseEvent })`: returns a broadcaster that fans out the same synthetic UI event to SSE and WS clients.
- `createMessageStreamWsRuntime(...)`: mounts the message-stream WS server, upgrade handler, and SSE-to-WS bridge onto the web HTTP server.

### Event translation
- `translateWireEvent(payload)`: one v2 wire event in, zero or more server-vocabulary events out.
- `wireEventDirectory(payload)`: the directory an event belongs to, read from `payload.location.directory`.
- `forwardTranslatedWireEvent(payload, handle)`: translate and forward, for consumers that take one handler.

### Coalescing helpers
- `createDeltaCoalescer(...)`: merges consecutive streaming fragments before replay and fan-out. In OpenCode 2.x the merged shapes are `session.text.delta`, `session.reasoning.delta` and `session.tool.input.delta` (v1 had a single `message.part.delta`); every other event is a barrier. Text and reasoning fragments are keyed by `data.ordinal`, tool input by `data.id`.
- `resolveDeltaCoalesceWindowMs(env)`: reads `OPENCHAMBER_EVENT_DELTA_COALESCE_MS`. Unset means 50ms, `0` turns coalescing off, and anything that is not a whole number from 0 to 1000 keeps the default with a warning.

### Upstream reader helpers
- `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS`: default idle timeout before an attached upstream SSE fetch is aborted for reconnect (20 s). `UPSTREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_CONCURRENT_MS` is the window while more than one session is active (40 s). The stall window must stay above `OPENCODE_SSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (15 s), the gap between the `: heartbeat` comments OpenCode 2.x writes on an idle stream; at or below it, every idle stream is torn down and reopened on each window (dezren39/nix#668).
- `timeouts.js`: the three windows and their environment overrides. `OPENCHAMBER_UPSTREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS` sets the stall window, `OPENCHAMBER_UPSTREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_CONCURRENT_MS` the concurrent one and `OPENCHAMBER_RESUME_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` the resume idle bound (10 s). Each is read once at startup, as whole milliseconds from 1,000 to 600,000; a value outside that, or not a whole number, logs a warning and keeps its default.
- `DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS`: default delay between upstream reconnect attempts.
- `createUpstreamSseReader(...)`: creates a start/stop reader for OpenCode SSE streams. The reader parses SSE blocks, tracks the latest `Last-Event-ID`, reconnects after closed or stalled upstream streams, and reports events through callbacks.
- `UPSTREAM_SSE_MAX_BUFFERED_CHARS` (4 MiB): cap on the reader's retained partial (separator-less) block, and `SSE_CURSOR_MAX_PENDING_CHARS` (4 MiB): the same cap for `createSseCursor`'s pending block in `sse-cursor.js`. Complete blocks may be larger; only text retained waiting for a `\n\n` separator is bounded.

### Cursor helpers
- `isOpenCodeEventId(id)`: true for OpenCode's `<instance>:<sequence>` form, the only id OpenCode can replay from.
- `encodeOpenChamberCursor({ stream, position, upstream })`, `decodeOpenChamberCursor(cursor)`, `isOpenChamberCursor(cursor)`: the versioned OpenChamber cursor `occ1.<stream>.<position>.<upstream>`. The `occ1.` prefix cannot collide with an OpenCode id; the stream token and position are validated before a replay.

### Durable store
- `createReplayStore({ filePath, ... })`: a bounded append-only store for the global stream's local frames, its head position and upstream cursor, and its retention watermarks. Without a `filePath` it keeps the same records in memory.
- `resolveGlobalReplayFilePath(env, home)`: the global stream's file under `OPENCHAMBER_DATA_DIR`, or `~/.config/openchamber` when unset.

## Runtime behavior
- Browser clients connect to the WS endpoints above.
- OpenChamber still fetches OpenCode upstream event streams over SSE, now from `/api/event`.
- OpenCode 2.x sends no `id:` SSE lines: the event id is `payload.id` and the directory is `payload.location.directory`. Replay and per-directory routing read both out of the payload.
- Browser clients receive the RAW wire payload and translate it themselves. Server-side subscribers read `event.translated()` instead, so the translation happens once per event and only when something listens.
- v2 emits no `session.status` and no `session.idle` of its own: live status is synthesized from `session.execution.started|succeeded|interrupted|failed`, plus `session.retry.scheduled` (status `retry` while a provider error waits for the next attempt) and `session.step.started` (back to `busy`, which clears `retry` once the attempt begins). A user abort arrives as `session.idle` with `aborted: true`, not as an assistant message carrying `MessageAbortedError`. A `session.execution.interrupted` with `reason: "shutdown"` translates to nothing: OpenCode keeps the execution claim across a shutdown and resumes the turn after restart, so the session stays busy for server consumers (goal, queue, notifications) until the real terminal event arrives.
- The web server creates one shared global message-stream hub. OpenCode watcher side effects and global WS clients subscribe to that hub, so there is one upstream `/global/event` SSE reader for both server-side processing and browser fan-out.
- The global hub keeps a bounded replay buffer of every state frame committed in this process: OpenCode's own events and the local frames OpenCode cannot reconstruct. Each entry carries a stream position and the OpenCode id it sits after. A frame sent to a browser carries a versioned OpenChamber cursor (`occ1.global.<position>.<upstream>`); the browser stores the last applied frame's cursor and sends it back as `lastEventId`. A cursor is answered from the buffer when the buffer is contiguous from the frame it names, otherwise from durable local frames plus an upstream read, and otherwise with a reset. A raw OpenCode id is still accepted as a legacy cursor.
- Local frames (a synthetic announcement, an event with no OpenCode id) are written to the durable store before they are sent, together with the head position and upstream cursor. Upstream frames are not persisted: OpenCode replays them. The store is bounded by count, bytes and age; when a local frame is dropped, a cursor that would have replayed it gets `replayReset: true` and the browser refetches rather than skip it. A reset record does the same for a resync.
- A resume after an OpenChamber restart loads the persisted head, so the shared reader resumes from the last upstream cursor instead of starting at the tail, and replays the local frames the browser missed, interleaved with the upstream events they followed. A read that sees a local frame commit while it runs, or an upstream resync, resets the client.
- A frame is committed to the buffer and, for a local frame, to the durable store before it is sent, so a cursor never names a frame that cannot be replayed. Replay is duplicate-safe by position: a client receives exactly the frames after the position its cursor names, never one it already applied.
- Replay retains at most 2,048 events and 8 MiB of UTF-8 wire frames, and durable local frames at most 512 entries, 2 MiB and 24 hours. An oversized upstream event still reaches live clients in full, but clears the retained suffix so replay cannot cross its gap. A missing replay cursor returns `null`, distinct from a complete empty tail.
- The hub numbers every event that arrives without an SSE id (`oc-<process>-<sequence>`) so fan-out has an id; that id never reaches a browser. `server.connected` is OpenCode's greeting to one upstream connection, sent outside its feed. A greeting with an OpenCode id line is an ordinary upstream event; an id-less one goes live without a cursor and is never replayed.
- A client whose cursor the buffer cannot answer is resumed on a read of its own (see `openUpstreamAfter`). That read ends at the first event the buffer holds, and the client goes live after the buffer's tail from there. Or, when a connected read delivers nothing for the resume idle bound (10 s, `OPENCHAMBER_RESUME_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`), the read ends and the client goes live with nothing to replay, since OpenCode had nothing after the cursor. The bound is its own value, not derived from the stall window; it is meant to outlast a reader's reconnect, so a connection that went quiet is reconnected by its own reader before the read gives up on it. A read that never connected, or is down when the bound passes, refetches instead. `resumeIdleTimeoutMs` overrides the bound for a hub built in code.
- Directory WS clients still attach one upstream `/event?directory=...` SSE reader per connection because directory streams are scoped.
- If an upstream SSE stream stalls after the browser WS is already ready, the reader aborts that upstream fetch and reconnects upstream with `Last-Event-ID`, keeping the browser WS alive when recovery is fast.
- When the shared global upstream reconnects after it was previously ready, the global WS bridge sends a fresh `ready` frame to already-ready browser clients. The browser treats this as a reconnect edge and can run scoped state repair without requiring the browser WS to close.
- Health checks are reserved for initial upstream connect failures and explicit upstream-unavailable responses, not for ordinary stall recovery on an already-established stream.
- Global synthetic events such as `openchamber:session-status`, `openchamber:session-activity`, `openchamber:notification`, and `openchamber:heartbeat` are preserved on the WS path, but heartbeat frames are emitted only while an upstream SSE stream is actively attached.
- Global UI broadcasts are fan-out capable across both SSE and WS clients.
- Global UI broadcasts serialize once per wire format, irrespective of client count. The SSE writer accepts an optional pre-serialized payload; isolated callers keep the two-argument contract. Failed or backpressured clients cannot block delivery to healthy clients.
- The reusable upstream reader centralizes SSE fetch/parsing/reconnect behavior for the WS runtime and OpenCode watcher. Additional event consumers should move to it only with parity tests for their lifecycle and error semantics.
- Browser transport concerns live in the WS bridge modules; server-side global stream ownership lives in `global-hub.js`.

## Durable cursors and the delivery guarantee

The practical guarantee is replay with deduplication, not exactly-once delivery and not exactly-once side effects. A browser receives every frame after the position its cursor names, at most once per reconnect, and refetches when the server cannot honour the cursor. Server-side consumers that act on events (goals, notifications, queue) must still treat their own effects as idempotent: a frame can be delivered more than once across independent recovery paths, and a local frame can be replayed after a restart.

A cursor is invalid, expired or upstream-unhonourable when its stream token is not `global`, its position is beyond the head, a local frame it would need was dropped by retention, or OpenCode answers its upstream id with a resync. Each of these produces the existing `replayReset: true` ready frame and a refetch; none of them skips data.

Directory-scoped streams keep raw OpenCode ids and have no durable local frames: they are scoped to one directory and one reader per connection.

## Delta coalescing
OpenCode publishes one `message.part.delta` per token fragment. A 5.7 KB answer measured 3,402 delta events of 1.7 characters each, 97% of all frames and 1.3 MB on the wire. The hub merges them before replay and fan-out, which cut that stream to 483 frames and 197 KB with identical text. Replay holds merged frames too, so its 2,048 entries cover about seven times more streaming time.

Merging is lossless because of three rules. Change one only with the randomized test in `delta-coalescer.test.js` still passing.

- Every event that is not a well-formed delta is a barrier. All pending text is emitted before it, so a delta never crosses a part snapshot or a status change.
- Deltas of different part fields commute, so several stay pending at once. They are emitted in the order their latest fragment arrived, which keeps event ids in upstream order.
- A merged event carries the id of its last fragment. A client cursor is the id of the last frame it received, so it always names a boundary between merged events.

Pending text is bounded by time (the 50ms window), by size (64 KiB), and by part fields (64). Reaching a bound emits early. Nothing is dropped. The first delta after a quiet spell is emitted at once, so time to first text does not grow.

The hub commits pending text when it stops, so it reaches the retained replay suffix, and the global bridge commits it before it marks a socket ready. A client readied later therefore receives exactly the events that arrived after it was ready, as it did before coalescing, and a reconnecting client receives the committed text through replay.

Verified against a live server by dropping the socket every 150ms to 3s during a stream and resuming from the cursor: the reconstructed text matched byte for byte with no duplicate ids. Server-side hub subscribers receive merged events as well. None of them reads individual deltas.

The directory WS bridge and the SSE proxy (`/api/global/event`, used by Capacitor) still forward unmerged events.

## Decisions

### Why a versioned cursor and not a raw OpenCode id

OpenCode cannot replay an OpenChamber local frame, and a raw OpenCode id carries no OpenChamber position, so after a restart it can resume past a local frame the browser missed. The versioned cursor carries both the stream position and the upstream id; the `occ1.` prefix keeps it from ever being mistaken for an OpenCode id. Raw OpenCode ids remain accepted as a legacy cursor, and only while no local frame is known.

### Why partial SSE buffers are capped, and overflow drops the partial block

A separator-less upstream stream otherwise grows the reader's and the proxy cursor's partial-block buffers without bound, and the stall watchdog cannot help because it resets on every chunk. Overflow in the reader is observable: it reports `upstream_buffer_overflow`, aborts, and reconnects from the last complete event id. The cursor has no error channel and its state only advances on complete blocks, so it drops the oversized partial block whole — keeping a tail could splice the flood onto the next block and corrupt its id — and parses the next complete block fresh.

### Why local frames are persisted and upstream frames are not

Upstream frames are reconstructible from OpenCode, so persisting them would duplicate the chat stream on disk and grow the store with the conversation. A local frame exists nowhere else, so it is written to the store before it is sent; the head position and upstream cursor are written with it so the shared reader resumes where it stopped.

### Why the position is committed before the frame is sent

A cursor names a frame the browser may have applied. If the frame were sent before its position was recorded, a restart between the two would leave the browser holding a cursor the server cannot replay and would have to reset it. Committing first makes the cursor always resolvable within retention.

### Why a resume read refetches when a local frame overtakes it

A per-client upstream read cannot place a local frame committed mid-read among the upstream frames it forwards. Refetching is the one extra round trip that keeps the client's state ordered; the durable store then replays the frame it missed.

## Notes for contributors
- Keep protocol helpers pure and small so they can be unit tested without spinning up a server.
- Keep `runtime.js` focused on WebSocket upgrade and endpoint dispatch. Put global browser-client lifecycle in `global-ws-bridge.js`, directory stream lifecycle in `directory-ws-bridge.js`, and upstream stream sharing in `global-hub.js`.
- Do not change upstream OpenCode transport assumptions here; OpenCode remains SSE-based.
- Keep global replay bounded; do not turn it into an unbounded event log.
