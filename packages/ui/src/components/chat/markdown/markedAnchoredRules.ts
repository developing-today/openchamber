/**
 * marked runs each block rule on the rest of the message at every block, and
 * each inline rule on the rest of the paragraph at every token. Its rules
 * start with `^`, and V8 gives up on them at the first character that does
 * not match. JavaScriptCore (Safari, the iOS app's WebView, Bun) retries a
 * failed `^` match at every later position, so each call reads the whole
 * remainder and a long message costs the square of its length: 16,000 short
 * paragraphs took about 70 s in Bun and the hr rule alone 7.9 s in the system
 * JavaScriptCore, against milliseconds in Node.
 *
 * The sticky flag (`y`) limits a match to one position in every engine. marked
 * never resets `lastIndex`, and a sticky match moves it, so `exec` starts every
 * match at 0, which is where `^` anchors it anyway. Matches are therefore the
 * same as before. Global rules keep `lastIndex` for marked's own loops and are
 * left as they are, as is `rules.other`. `split` and `matchAll` construct their
 * own regex through the species, which stays plain `RegExp`.
